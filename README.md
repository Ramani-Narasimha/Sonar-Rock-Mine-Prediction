# Sonar-Rock-Mine-Prediction

A **machine learning** project to classify SONAR signals as **rock** or **mine** using Python.

## üîç Project Overview
This project trains a **machine learning model** to analyze SONAR signals and classify them as:
- **Rocks** (non-threatening objects)
- **Mines** (potential threats)

##Dataset##

The dataset contains 208 SONAR signal samples with 60 frequency features and a binary label (`R` for Rock or `M` for Mine)

File: `Sonar data.csv` 

---
**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing
- Model training (Logistic Regression)
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix,classification report)

## üìä Results
- **Final Model Accuracy:** 76.19%  
- **Dataset Size:** 208 samples (60 features)  
- **Validation Method:** 90-10 train-test split
